# MorphDemo
This basic Python GUI was built to allow simple interaction with a morphing octocopter drone simulation I created. A morphing drone is a drone that changes the position of its rotors while flying. 

The demo requires specific package versions - if you would like to preserve the package versions on your global system, create a virtual environment before using requirements.txt
## Installation
On your Linux machine, clone this repository using `git clone <repo URL>`. Next, cd into the cloned directory and run the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When the installation is finished, initialize the GUI by running `python MorphDemo.py`
